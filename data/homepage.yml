  heading: “What happens after I reach my ideal weight?”
  lead: That’s the elephant in the room, isn’t it? We know **you can grab the med
    anywhere these days, diets work for a while, and anyone can help you lose
    weight** but no one’s teaching people how to actually keep the weight off
    after you lose it. It seems like most companies don’t even care – they know
    you’ll just keep come back again like you always have.
  reviews:
    - name: Jennifer R.
      quote: Weight has been a **constant battle my whole life**. I lost over 50 lbs
        and now I finally feel like I can actually keep it off for real this
        time.
    - name: Kylee B.
      quote: "**Dieting is the actual worst**. I feel like I’ve never truly enjoyed
        food – I always felt so bad eating ‘bad foods.’ These guys totally
        changed the way I think (and eat) forever!"
    - name: Samantha T.
      quote: It’s literally crazy how simple they made it to lose weight and how
        practical life can be after. I still have all the foods I love (yes,
        even carbs). **It’s a dream come true**.

one_in_a_million:
  heading: You could be 1 in 235 million
  copy: That’s oddly specific, isn’t it? Losing weight is tough, but we know the
    first step is actually the easiest. The real challenge is changing your
    life. That's why we're aiming to help 235,000 overweight Americans **build a
    healthy relationship with food** so they can lose the weight and keep it off
    for good. That number might seem huge but it accounts for just 0.1% of the
    235 million people struggling with weight loss— but we believe that even
    small steps can lead to big changes. We might not change the world, but if
    we can help change someone’s world, we're good with that. Hey, maybe that
    could be yours.
