  heading: “What happens after I reach my ideal weight?”
  lead: That’s the elephant in the room, isn’t it? We know **you can grab the med
    anywhere these days, diets work for a while, and anyone can help you lose
    weight,** but no one’s teaching people how to actually keep the weight off
    after you lose it. It seems like most companies don’t even care – they know
    you’ll just keep coming back again like you always have.

  heading: You could be 1 in 235 million
  copy: >-
    That’s oddly specific, isn’t it? Losing weight is tough, but we know the
    first step is actually the easiest. The real challenge is changing your
    life. That's why we're aiming to help 235,000 overweight Americans **restore
    a healthy relationship with food** so that they can lose the weight and keep
    it off for good. 


    That number might seem huge but it accounts for just 0.1% of the 235 million people struggling with weight loss— but we believe that even small steps can lead to big changes. We might not change the world, but if we can help change someone’s world, we're good with that. Hey, maybe that could be yours.

    Look, we’re not into making scammy claims about how much you’ll lose. Let’s
    be real: losing weight is the easy part, and everyone is different. The real
    challenge is *keeping it off*. We can’t promise you’ll stick with it because
    you’re the one who has to make that happen. 


    What we can promise is a program you’ll love, a fresh perspective on food, results that make you feel great, and support when things get tough. If after 30 days in our concierge nutrition program you’re not seeing real changes, feeling pumped, or learning something new about your food journey, no worries – full refund (minus meds).


    So, ditch the scale, grab a slice of pizza (yes, really), and let’s kick off this journey together. Weight loss doesn’t have to be suffering, and we’re here to prove it.
